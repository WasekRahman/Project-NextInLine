Pandemic, that is all we have on the news, everywhere we go out, or even staying at
home. Learning to live with the new normal which just not limits us from our meeting
loved ones, but also includes social distancing, wearing masks, limit on number of
people that could be present at a place.

Our web-based application is to help us get through this time of pandemic. Going
around in Windsor to banks, malls, or local store there is certain limit on number of
people that could enter. We have seen an employee of the store assigned at the door at
most places to count the people entering to maintain the limit. As well as long queue
outside of a lot of businesses before you can enter the store.

We propose to make an application, “Next in Line”. A sensor will be placed at the entry
and exit points of store. It would help monitor the occupancy and notify the employee
when at or over capacity. This application can be enhanced further, if the queue/waiting
is long then customers can register online, they can get their queue number/token and
will be notified via text or email they are next in line to enter the store.

This application will ensure that the employ work force can achieve their prime goal of
serving customers sparing one more employee to do so, increasing their productivity in
result. Apart from that people has been waiting in queue for hours to get their work done
for instance Ontario Service, all the banks. This application will help small
business/large corporation in to ensure safety of their customers/employees.

We plan to build our system with PHP, MySQL along with a little involvement of a
hardware. In our project we will be simulating the sensors. This approach will evolve
with any changes, needs coming along the way or if proposed by client.
